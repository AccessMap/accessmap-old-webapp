    .row.text-center
      p We want to make a reliable, safe trip planner for people with limited mobility (like a Google Maps for sidewalks). To make routing happen, we need to represent the sidewalks of Seattle as lines that are connected to one another.

      h2 But the data is messy, so we have to clean it

      p The Seattle Department of Transportation has provided us a fantastic #[ahref('http://data.seattle.gov') dataset] of Seattle's sidewalks, but the exact locations for each sidewalk aren't perfectly accurate. As a result, the lines that represent the sidewalks don't match up perfectly end-to-end, making routing impossible.
      p Over the summer of 2015, the #[a(href='http://escience.washington.edu/get-involved/data-science-for-social-good/') UW Data Science for Social Good] project provided us with #[a(href='http://escience.washington.edu/research-project/sidewalk-maps-for-low-mobility-citizens/') the brainpower] to write algorithms that clean up the sidewalk data. Using that method, we have developed machine learning methods that we hope will make it easy to expand AccessMap to other cities.

      h2 How you can help - connect sidewalks that don't cross streets
      .col-md-10.col-md-offset-1
        img(src='images/improve/example_connect.png')
    .row.text-center
      p We need help your help in verifying where the sidewalks really are. For this, we've developed a game of sorts, where you identify whether a sidewalk crosses a street or not. This can sometimes be a difficult task, since the sidewalk locations are so messy.
      p You will be presented with a map of two sidewalk lines (in blue) connected by a green line. We draw the green line just to tell you which ends of the sidewalks we're asking about. In the example above, the sidewalks should definitely be connected. #[b If in doubt, click the 'satellite' toggle to get an aerial view].
      p If the blue lines should be considered one sidewalk, click #[b Yes].

    .row.text-center
      p If the blue sidewalk lines would be connected across the street, they are clearly disconnected - you'd have to cross the street!
      p If the blue lines should be considered separate sidewalk, click #[b No].

      h2 Beware of noisy data
      .col-md-10.col-md-offset-1
        img(src='images/improve/example_popup.png')
    .row.text-center
      p Sometimes, the data is so noisy that sidewalks will appear to cross the street. You can click on the sidewalks to show information about the sidewalk, e.g. the side of the street (S = South) and the streets bordering the sidewalk (the map is oriented with North at the top). If you're still unsure after checking the popups, hit refresh (F5) on your browser to get a new sidewalk.
