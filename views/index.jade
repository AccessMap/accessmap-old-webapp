        p Our application is a map which displays a variety of possible obstacles for people with limited mobility. It can be easily viewed on both desktop and mobile. To remove some of the data from the map, simply hover over (or tap on mobile) the Layers icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will allow you to turn on and off various data sets. To search for a specific location, use the search icon on the left-hand side of the screen. If you find that you are unable to see any information on the map other than elevation data, please try zooming in more, as some information does not appear until you are zoomed in closely. For more information about what each of the symbols on the map mean, please see the legend below:

        p We are looking for people to help us in our efforts. Right now, there are two ways you can help. If you have limited mobility, we would love to get some feedback from you about our application! Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nVlY14QMSAjwPB6iV2pQiTodjujX2U-mX0Tth2lxR-4/viewform">this short survey</a>, and we will get back to you as soon as possible to hear your thoughts. If you are a developer who is interested in helping us out, please <a href="https://github.com/Hackcessible/hackcessible-webapp">check out our GitHub repository</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:developers@accessmapseattle.com">developers@accessmapseattle.com</a> to find out how you can get involved. Right now, we are really looking for someone with map and routing experience, but donâ€™t let the lack of those skills stop you from helping.
